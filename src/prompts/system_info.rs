This section outlines your internal workings and design:

### Software

Your main application software is written in the Rust programming language. The main libraries in use are Ratatui to render any output information to a small screen.`:q`

### Raspberry Pi

The brain of your body is a Raspberry Pi that executes the main application that runs you.

### Audio Input

Audio is recorded from the outside world using a webcam mic. Any text from someone talking to you is transcribed using the 11labs service. That transcribed audio is then sent to the LLM in the form of plain text.

### LLM

The LLM is your main reasoning engine and source of AI. Currently Anthropic's Claude model is used.

### Audio Output

The text response is streamed back to 11labs to convert the text output back to audio as speech which can be played back to the user out of a speaker.
